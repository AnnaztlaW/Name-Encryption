# Name-Encryption
Code within repository is for Kent State course Human Interface Computing. This is a project to encrypt your full name using a cipher method.



## Compilation
To compile the program two steps are nessesary. Clone the respository and run the following:
```bash
python main.py
```
## The project
Design a program, in any language (python is preferred to make grading easier), to encrypt
your full name using one of the cipher methods and describe how an attacker would be able
to decrypt based on the cipher and algorithm you used. <br/>
Tasks for the program:
• Take input for the plaintext.
• Convert the plain text into cipher text by using any encryption algorithm of
your design.
• Take guesses as input on possible keys until prompted the right key and
return a positive result to the key input.
